When installing services on machines that play the role of server, these 
are usually installed with default settings, which are basic and do not
usually take into account factors as important as security.
This paper intends to study exhaustively some of the main
services that are used today in servers, such as Apache, Nginx, MariaDB,
NFS and Samba, so that useful information is available when installing them
to configure them securely.
Files will also be provided to automate the secure configuration of
them through the use of Ansible, and finally media will be provided
to deploy them and test their operation using Docker.
Thus, this text is intended to be a reference guide for any type of user
with a basic knowledge can deploy these services making sure that
the level of security you have is sufficient.
